Cleanuparr is a tool for automating the cleanup of unwanted or blocked files in Sonarr, Radarr, and supported download clients like qBittorrent. It removes incomplete or blocked downloads, updates queues, and enforces blacklists or whitelists to manage file selection. After removing blocked content, Cleanuparr can also trigger a search to replace the deleted shows/movies.

Cleanuparr was created primarily to address malicious files, such as `*.lnk` or `*.zipx`, that were getting stuck in Sonarr/Radarr and required manual intervention. Some of the reddit posts that made Cleanuparr come to life can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonarr/comments/1gqnx16/psa_sonarr_downloaded_a_virus/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonarr/comments/1gqwklr/sonar_downloaded_a_mkv_file_which_looked_like_a/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonarr/comments/1gpw2wa/downloaded_waiting_to_import/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonarr/comments/1gpi344/downloads_not_importing_no_files_found/).

Think of **Cleanuparr** as the janitor of your server; it keeps your download queue spotless, removes clutter, and blocks malicious files. Now imagine combining that with **Huntarr**, the compulsive librarian who finds missing and upgradable media to complete your collection

While **Huntarr** fills in the blanks and improves what you already have, **Cleanuparr** makes sure that only clean downloads get through. If you're aiming for a reliable and self-sufficient setup, **Cleanuparr** and **Huntarr** will take your automated media stack to another level.
