# Hardlinks Settings

These settings control how the Download Cleaner handles downloads with no hardlinks remaining (they are not available in the arrs anymore).

The Download Cleaner will change the category of a download that has no hardlinks and the new category can be cleaned based on the rules configured [here](/docs/configuration/download-cleaner/categories).

<Important>
    If you are using Docker, make sure to mount the downloads directory the same way it is mounted for the download client.
    If your download client's download directory is `/downloads`, it should be the same for Cleanuperr.
</Important>

<Warning>
    While it is not needed to configure the arrs for this feature, it is recommended you do. If the arrs are not configured, downloads that are waiting to be imported might be affected by it.
</Warning>
